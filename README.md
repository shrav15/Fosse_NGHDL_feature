# Fosse_NGHDL_feature
Software- E-sim-2.1
NGHDL feature facilitates creation of user-defined models for mixed-signal circuit simulation in eSim. By interfacing GHDL and Ngspice, we achieve mixed-signal simulation.
Digital models are simulated using GHDL and XSpice engine of Ngspice.
steps :

-Comparator vhdl file is created and schematics circuit is drawn 
-Through Ki-CAD simulation feature, transient features are set up, and source voltage and default parameters can also be changed.
-After converting ki-CAD files into .cir (netlist files ) , simulations can be performed.
